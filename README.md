# mixed-fractions-operations-ios
Simple iOS Application that Performs operations for mixed fractions.

Legal operators are * (multiplication),  / (division),  + (addition),  - (subtraction), and  % (modulo).
Operands and operators are to be separated by one or more spaces.
Mixed numbers are represented by Whole&Numerator/Denominator (for example: "3&1/4", and “-1&7/8”).
Improper fractions, whole numbers, and negative numbers are allowed as operands.
