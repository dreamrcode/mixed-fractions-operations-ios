# mixed-fractions-operations-ios

<p/>Simple iOS Application that performs operations for mixed fractions. <br>
Legal operators are * (multiplication),  / (division),  + (addition),  - (subtraction), and  % (modulo). <br>
Operands and operators are to be separated by one or more spaces.<br>
Mixed numbers are represented by Whole&Numerator/Denominator (for example: "3&1/4", and “-1&7/8”). <br>
Improper fractions, whole numbers, and negative numbers are allowed as operands. <p/>

<h2>Example Operations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Operation: 1/2 * 3&3/4<br>Result: 1&7/8</li>
<li>Operation: 2&3/8 + 9/8<br>Result: 3&1/2</li>
<li>Operation: 1&3/4 - 2<br>Result: -1/4</li>
<li>Operation: 11 % 3<br>Result: 2</li>
</ul>
